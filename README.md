# Minishell README: Understanding Pipes and Builtins

## Pipes

### Where to start?

A file descriptor is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an opened file or a network .... bla, bla, bla.
The most important thing to memorize:
0 (Standard Input) - where we read
1 (Standard Output) - we we write
2 (Standard Error) - it exists and itâ€™s amazing


### <p align = center> We start with reading and after that writing... If we didnâ€™t read, we canâ€™t write...</p>

During our experiments we are going to break everything down several times, so we need to create a copy of original fd, and play with them:

`int input = dup(0)`<br>
`int output = dup(1)`

Here we need to check if we have a file, if not we need to copy our input, cause we gonna do nasty things.

We remember that we read from 0, but now we have fd_input.
What to do? Redirect!

`dup2(fd_input, 0)`

Now we have a familiar and understandable 0... but...
This weird fd_input is on the way, letâ€™s get rid of it!

`close(fd_input)`

Before going with the flow we need to figure out where our water goes: fd our outfile?

`if (infile)`<br>
  `  fd_input = infile;`
  <br>
`else`<br>
  `  fd_input = dup(input);`
      

Cool cool cool

Letâ€™s send the info! As I mentioned before we can write only to 1
Letâ€™s get rid of weird fd_output and use beautiful 1

`dup2 (fd_output, 1)`<br>
`close(fd_output)`

<br clear="left"/>


### What if we have a pipe?

LOOP

We did the same thing:
Decided where we get information, redirected to 0, closed ugly fd_input.

In this case output can go only to the pipe, thatâ€™s why we donâ€™t have freedom to choose outfile

Our pipe should also have file descriptors - it also wants to read and write, letâ€™s give it to her:
`pipe(fdpipe)` - now our pipe fdâ€™s can talk to each other

`fd_output = fdpipe[1]`<br>
`fd_input = fdpipe[0]`

Our program still claims to see 1 as a place where it can write, letâ€™s give it:

`dup2 (fd_output, 1)`<br>
`close(fd_output)`

But now we see the second block/command that wants to get itâ€™s part of the deal ...

<br clear="left"/>


- **First Command:**
  - Transformation of input: `0->(stdin or file)->0->fdpipe[0]`
  - Transformation of output: `1->fdpipe[1]->1`

- **Second Command:**
  - Transformation of input: `fdpipe[0]->0->fdpipe[0]`
  - Transformation of output: `1->fdpipe[1]->1`

- **Last Command:**
  - Transformation of input: `fdpipe[0]->0`
  - Transformation of output: `1->(stdin or file)->1`

### What does our parent do?

Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
He wants to fix everything that was done and he redirects to our dear buddies - 0 and 1:

`dup2(input, 0)`<br>
`dup2(output, 1)`

and of course donâ€™t forget to close our experiments:

`close(input)`<br>
`close(output)`

### Builtins

Minishell's built-in functions are executed by the parent process. For functions like `echo -n` and `exit`, their behavior is carefully managed:

- **Echo -n:** Both `-n` and `-nnnnnnnnn` prevent the trailing newline, ensuring precise output behavior.

- **Exit:**
  - If provided with one numeric argument, `exit` works as expected.
  - Multiple numeric arguments result in an error and prevent the exit.
  - Non-numeric arguments also trigger an error message.
  - Using `exit` alone writes "exit".


### Environment

First, I created a shorten copy of the environment variables **`envp_copy`** and started playing with them. Within this part I also created my ft_getenv that goes through the envp_copy.
There are 3 options for setting new variables:
1. The variable already exists and overwriting is forbidden:
   
  **`my_setenv("HOME", "test1", 0, &envp_copy)`**; //0 = overwrite is not allowed
  
  In this case we don't change the envp_copy.

  
2. The variable doesn't exist:

  **`my_setenv("TEST1", "test1", 1, &envp_copy)`**;
  
  We add 1 more line with our new variable.

  
3. The variable already exists and overwriting is allowed:

  **`my_setenv("OLDPWD", "/home/Desktop", 1, &envp_copy)`**; //1 = overwrite is allowed
  
  We delete old variable and add a new one.


Understanding these concepts is fundamental for Minishell development, enabling you to create a robust and efficient command-line interface. Happy coding! ðŸš€
